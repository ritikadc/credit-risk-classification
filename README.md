# credit-risk-classification
Module_20_Challenge
I split the data into training and testing sets, I created a logistic regression model with the original data. I made a credit risk analysis report. I opened the starter_code notebook and read the lending_data.csv file. I created the labels set y from the loan status column and created the features x Dataframe from the remaining columns. I split the data into training and testing data using train_test_split. I created a logistic regression model with the original data. I fit a logistic regression model by using the training data (x_train and y_train). I saved the predicitons for the testing data by using the testing feature data (x-test) and fitted the model. I answered how well does the logistic regression model predict both the 0 (healthy person) and 1 (high-risk loan labels. I wrote a brief report that includes a summary and an analysis of the performance of the machine learning models. I explained the purpose of this analysis. I descirbed the accuracy score, the precision score and I recalled the core for the machine learning. I summarized the results from the machine learning model
